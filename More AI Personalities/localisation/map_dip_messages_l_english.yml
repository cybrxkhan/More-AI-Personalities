 PC_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "We believe it necessary to enlighten lesser cultures such as yourselves, but the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] savages are so primitive it's hard to tell whether it's even possible with your species..."
 PC_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Sometimes we read about the squalid conditions of your people, and wonder how anyone could live in such a state of nature."
 PC_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "It's undeniable that you are barbarians that need to be taught proper etiquette. Meeting you is always a painful experience."
 PC_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Look at the pathetic, primitive [From.GetSpeciesName]. Some day we will civilize you, hard as it might be."
 PC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "It seems that your people are primitive. Perhaps you would like to learn more about our superior culture?"
 PC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "It is difficult for us to understand your primitive customs, but we try for the sake of diplomacy."
 PC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "We have your best interests in mind. Some day, we shall teach you the proper ways of civilization, somehow. It is the [Root.GetSpeciesAdj]'s burden."
 PC_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "What can we expect from filthy little heathens? You're savages! Savages!"
 PC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Despite hailing from a primitive, undeveloped culture, we feel that [From.GetSpeciesName] can be considered noble savages."
 PC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Endure, good friends! Someday you will be as civilized as us."
 PC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Some heathen savages refuse to accept the superiority of our culture, and refuse to civilize themselves. We are glad you are not one of those."
 PC_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Savages! Savages! Dirty shrieking devils! Barely even sentient!"
 PC_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "We have tried our hardest to teach the [From.GetSpeciesName] and raise them to an acceptable level of civilization. It seems that we must resort to force now."
 PC_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Savages! Savages! Now we sound the drums of war!"
 # Vassal greetings

 # Savage Raiders
 SR_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesName] seem... vulnerable. Better be careful, or else we might just... pillage you..."
 SR_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "As much as we like pillaging our foes, it seems that the uncultured and pathetic [From.GetSpeciesName] are devoid of worthwhile objects to plunder."
 SR_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesName] have grown complacent and lazy. Would be a shame of anyone tried attacking you, seizing all of your riches..."
 SR_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "We're just playing nice with you for now. Prepare now, pathetic [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]! We'll be raiding and pillaging you eventually."
 SR_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Your people seem to have some riches we might desire eventually..."
 SR_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Who needs diplomacy when we could just pillage you? Don't worry, we'll start raiding you eventually, but for now we've decided to leave you be."
 SR_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "We are not one for false pleasantries such as this, as we prefer pillaging our enemies. Still, we'll listen, for now."
 SR_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "The [From.GetName] are arrogant and decadent. Soon, we'll be nipping away at your strength."
 SR_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Your people are wise and strong. It would be unwise for us to provoke such a mighty nation with our usual raids. Perhaps you have an enemy we can pillage?"
 SR_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "We consider the [From.GetSpeciesName] to be a worthy and honorable adversary. As such, we shall not pillage your lands unless necessary."
 SR_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Though it is in our nature to raid and pillage, we recognize it when we see a great nation such as the [From.GetSpeciesName], and we promise not to offend you in any way."
 SR_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Bah! Back to pillaging! Back to raiding! Begone before we kill you all!"
 SR_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Beware, [From.GetRulerName]! The greatest joy for a [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] warrior is to defeat his enemies, to drive them before him, to take from them all they possess, to see those they love in tears, and to hold their wives and daughters in his arms."
 SR_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "We will pillage you so thoroughly your people shall languish in poverty and starvation until the end of time!"
 # Vassal greetings

 DOTF_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Heathen! The heavens shall smite you for your blasphemous ways!"
 DOTF_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "You are a threat to true believers across the galaxy. You are in league with the demons and devils, no doubt. A warning - our holy warriors are trained to fight against your type."
 DOTF_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "How can we ever reason with heretics such as the [From.GetSpeciesName]? Someday, we will fight a holy war against you, no doubt."
 DOTF_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "See the might of our faith! Cower before our holy knights, heathen!"
 DOTF_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Be you heaven-fearing friend, or demon-following foe? This is something our clergy will have to look into."
 DOTF_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Maybe we will have to wage a holy war against you one day. Maybe not. Only time will tell..."
 DOTF_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "We are more than willing to live in peace, but if you so as much threaten the sanctity of our faith, our holy knights shall show you no mercy."
 DOTF_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Do not be prideful, heathens. Our holy knights are protected by the heavens, your heretical warriors are nothing."
 DOTF_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Ah! Our good friends! What heathens have you smote as of late?"
 DOTF_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Perhaps we will be able to rid the universe of the demons and devils one day."
 DOTF_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Heresy is a terrible thing. We are glad that you are not blasphemers. Otherwise our holy knights would've had to take care of you."
 DOTF_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "HEAVEN WILLS IT! DEATH TO THE HEATHENS!"
 DOTF_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Coward. That's all you are. Our holy knights are protected by faith in this holy war. Heaven wills it!"
 DOTF_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "What hope have you against the truth, false believer? Our armies shall prevail in this holy war."
 # Vassal greetings
 DOTF_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Yes, noble master? Shall we wage holy war against our enemies today?"

 CH_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesName] are what exactly what's wrong with the system... you... you are a repressive people.... Something's wrong with your energy flow."
 CH_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Sometimes, I think that [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] just needs to relax... go with the flow... but it's like the [From.GetSpeciesName] can't."
 CH_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Why can't you just go with the flow? Accept the power? Just listen... and relax..."
 CH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Hey there, pal. Before we start negotiating, just take some deep breaths. In, and out. In, and out. Feel one with the universe."
 CH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Just because we're easygoing and prefer to go with the flow, doesn't mean we can't fight for ourselves... it makes us even more dangerous!"
 CH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Live in the present! Relax and be free! Then maybe we can have a enlightening discussion..."
 CH_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "[From.GetName] should be careful. The universe is infinite and beautiful and bountiful, your might is nothing compared to its wonders."
 CH_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "What a great day this is! The people of [Root.GetName] think that the [From.GetSpeciesName] are totally cool and radical."
 CH_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Together, we will both admire the beauty of our universe... be one with the universe... be the universe.... What was I saying?"
 CH_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out. Seeing the [From.GetSpeciesName] always makes me feel a sense of inner peace."
 CH_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Looks like someone needs to be taught a lesson on shown some inner peace..."
 CH_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "What's wrong with the [From.GetSpeciesName]? You all are so... uncool. That's why we have to fight you."
 CH_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "We fight against the system, we fight against you, vile authoritarian oppressors! Free the [From.GetSpeciesName]!"

 # Open-Minded Worshippers
 OMW_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Our scholars constantly try to find something good about the beliefs of the [From.GetSpeciesName], but always come up short."
 OMW_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Although we like to engage in an atmosphere of tolerance and understanding, it is difficult with those such as yourselves."
 OMW_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "We fear that the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] are growing up in an environment that is not conducive to their spiritual and personal development."
 OMW_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Though your culture is undeniably undeveloped and unsophisticated, we still believe it is important for us to be narrow-minded. It's not your fault your people are so... primitive."
 OMW_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Well met. We seek to better understand the beliefs of others. In doing so, we can better understand ourselves."
 OMW_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "We hope that the leaders of [From.GetName] are as willing to engage in fruitful dialogue about the differences and similarities between our cultures and belief systems."
 OMW_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "It is important that we understand each other spiritually, even if we don't believe the same things."
 OMW_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "We know that you look down on us, but please try to be open-minded, and understanding towards those who have different points of view."
 OMW_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Ah! Our friends! It is always our pleasure to have friendly, insightful debates with you about the nature of the cosmos."
 OMW_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Even if a [Root.GetSpeciesName] and a [From.GetSpeciesName] don't see eye to eye on some things, our similarities and mutual understanding are always greater than our differences and disagreements."
 OMW_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Engaging with religious debate with you is always a great honor. Though we may disagree on some key issues, we believe that the scholars of [From.GetName] merely have a different perspective, never a misguided or wrong one."
 OMW_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Sometimes, we must fight. It is sad, as your culture and beliefs have its beauty, but your leaders are a disagreeable lot."
 OMW_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "How our two peoples suffer! This is why we dislike war. Why can we not discuss our differences in an atmosphere of peace and understanding? But sometimes it is necessary to raise arms and wage war."
 OMW_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "We would much rather discuss our differences by means of a pleasant, intellectual conversation, but war works fine for us too."
 # Vassal greetings
 OMW_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "The [From.GetName] have such a beautiful and noble way of thinking. Even if we don't always agree with it, we are proud to be loyal followers of the [From.GetSpeciesName]."

 OMW_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! We hate conflict, we really do. But sometimes we have no choice."
 
 # Studious Builders
 SB_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "We are considering erecting a great monument to the stupidity and savagery of the [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 SB_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "It is difficult for our people to live in peace when they know that inelegant, unsophisticated fools such as the [From.GetSpeciesName] exist."
 SB_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "The [From.GetName] is a disgrace to the galaxy. We intend to build a great museum dedicated solely to explaining your failures and flaws."
 SB_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Maybe we should just destroy the [From.GetName] and use your ashes as building material. Or food. Either works."
 SB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "We the [Root.GetName] have little interest in your affairs, so long as you do not interfere in ours. Still, we are more than willing to negotiate treaties favorable to both parties."
 SB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "We did not expect you. Be forewarned, we are not interested in getting involved in any conflict you are part of, either as an ally or a foe."
 SB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Perhaps someday we shall send our best engineers and artisans to travel to your lands and study the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] methods of construction and how you manage your infrastructure."
 SB_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "We plead you to practice prudence. We have put a lot of work into building our society, and it would be a waste if you did anything to it!"
 SB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Hail! Perhaps someday we should construct a glorious monument to the friendship between our two peoples that utilizes the best engineering and architectural techniques and styles from both."
 SB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "It is an honor to speak with you. We prefer to focus on building up our own society, but we see no reason to mingle with loyal and trusted friends such as the [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 SB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "This is a wonderful opportunity for our engineers, scholars, and artisans to engage in dialogue and exchange ideas."
 SB_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Your society is not even worth destroying, but we will stamp you out like the pathetic [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] you are!"
 SB_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "After this war is over we shall erect a great monument celebrating our victory over the [From.GetName]!"
 SB_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "This war is costly but we must fight, it seems. Once we are done fighting, our leaders will construct a tall and mighty monument celebrating our victory over you, pathetic [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]."
 # Vassal greetings
 SB_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "We are glad to see you again. Perhaps you should patronize the construction of a great memorial celebrating our service and devotion to the [From.GetName]."
 # Declaration of War
 SB_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! Although our resources are usually devoted to building our society, celebrating our culture, and developing our infrastructure, we can easily use them to build a mighty war machine which will topple you as well!"
 
 # Hedonistic Visionaries (aka Bioshock references)
 HV_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "In the end what separates a [Root.GetSpeciesName] from a [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]? Money? Power? No, a [Root.GetSpeciesName] chooses, and a [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] obeys!"
 HV_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "What is the difference between a [Root.GetSpeciesName] and a [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]? A [Root.GetSpeciesName] builds. A [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] asks 'Where is my share?' A [Root.GetSpeciesName] creates. A [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] says, 'What will the neighbors think?' A [Root.GetSpeciesName] invents. A [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] says, 'Watch out, or you might tread on the toes of heaven... '"
 HV_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Would you kindly just leave the [Root.GetName] alone?"
 HV_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Would you kindly just grovel before us, pathetic slave?"
 HV_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "We all make choices, but in the end our choices make us. I am interested in knowing what sort of choices the [From.GetName] will make in the future."
 HV_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "I am a representative of [Root.GetName], and I'm here to ask the [From.GetName] a question. Is a [Root.GetSpeciesName] not entitled to the sweat of their brow?"
 HV_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "What is the greatest lie every created? What is the most vicious obscenity ever perpetrated on the [From.GetName]? Slavery? Genocide? Dictatorship? No. It's the tool with which all [From.GetSpeciesAdj] wickedness is built: altruism."
 HV_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Though you have much power, [From.GetSpeciesName], you are still slaves. A [Root.GetSpeciesName] is free, for he chooses. A [From.GetSpeciesName] must obey."
 HV_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "It was your strength of will that brought you here, and with that strength we shall build a better and brighter future for the galaxy."
 HV_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "A [Root.GetSpeciesName] chooses. A [From.GetSpeciesName] also chooses. Our two peoples are free. It is the parasites elsewhere in the galaxy that obey, mere slaves."
 HV_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "We consider the [Root.GetSpeciesName] to be great, just like us. Let the small not constrain the great! Let us be free to choose! We, of course, have chosen friendship with you."
 HV_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "A [Root.GetSpeciesName] chooses, and a [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] obeys! And we choose to fight this war until the bitter end!"
 HV_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "You can kill us all, but you will never have the [Root.GetSpeciesName]. Though our physical defences may fall, you'll never defeat [Root.GetName]. Our strength is not in steel and fire, but in intellect and will. That is what you [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] will never understand."
 HV_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "The [Root.GetName] came to this galaxy to build the impossible. The [From.GetName] came to rob what you could never build. We will defend ourselves, for we are free, and you are slaves!"
 # Vassal greetings
 HV_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Even in a book of lies sometimes you find truth. There is indeed a season for all things and in the present circumstances the [Root.GetName] knows it cannot raise their arms against the [From.GetName]. Be forewarned, though, we are free at heart, and not slaves. We do not obey, but merely choose to follow you."

 # Generous Philanthropists
 GP_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "You are an affront to peace-loving nations across the galaxy. You do not deserve our help, [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]."
 GP_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "The [Root.GetName] is dedicated to helping everyone prosper, but we do not think you are worthy of it. Reform your politics and your culture, and then we might reconsider."
 GP_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Coming to us to beg for our aid? We don't give any aid to inhumane, barbaric peoples like the [From.GetSpeciesName] who mistreat their own citizens."
 GP_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "We've considered helping the impoverished, pathetic kind, but that would be a waste of resources that could be better spent helping other undeveloped nations that actually need it."
 GP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Well met. We are more than happy to share our abundance with you, so long as you do the same."
 GP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "We are only here to help the rest of the galaxy. If you have similar interests, it is best you do not interfere."
 GP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "We welcome peace with your great nation. I pray that no future misunderstanding will come between our two peoples."
 GP_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Your arrogance knows no bound, [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]. Remember, just because you are powerful, doesn't mean you are right. We are all part of the galactic community, and you best understand that before it's too late."
 GP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Ah! Our good friends! Let us discuss how we can make the galaxy a better place. Surely there are many underdeveloped species that need our help."
 GP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "We have worked hard to make this galaxy a better place to live in. It is important we safeguard every species' basic dignity and inalienable rights."
 GP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Good, you have come just in time! This is a good opportunity as any other to talk about ways we can continue developing the galaxy for the betterment of all."

 # Vassal greetings

 GP_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! The [From.GetName] has been known for its gross violations of intergalactic law. You shall be punished for your transgressions. We do not hate the citizens of the [From.GetName], for we sympathize with their suffering under the brutal regime of [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName]."
 
 # Adventure Seekers (aka sort of millennials)
 AS_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "The galaxy is full of wonders waiting to be seen, with so many interesting worlds... except for [From.GetHomeWorldName], which is apparently a hive of scum and villainy."
 AS_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesName] are a useless pile of [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] manure. It's time you showed us some respect, you know? It's hard to believe anyone would want to live in a [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]-infested garbage landfill like [From.GetHomeWorldName]."
 AS_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Hurry up. We have more interesting worlds to explore, more interesting cuisines to sample, more interesting cultures to discover than yours."
 AS_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Most citizens of the [Root.GetName] believe that the [From.GetName] is full of ignorance and oppression. Our government encourages tourists to visit [From.GetHomeWorldName] so they can realize how good they have it and to not take their privilege for granted."
 AS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "We [Root.GetSpeciesName] are always willing to go on new adventures. Perhaps we can start be asking where we can get some authentic [From.GetSpeciesAdj] food? Culinary adventures are always a good way to begin a new adventure."
 AS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "So little time, so much to explore. There are a growing number of [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] tourists who would be interested in seeing the wonders of [From.GetHomeWorldName]"
 AS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "We are pioneers first and foremost, who seek to find the freshest, most authentic experiences possible. We hope that the ancient culture of the [From.GetName] can satisfy our wnaderlust."
 AS_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Check your privilege, [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]."
 AS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Our citizens started liking the culture and ways of the [From.GetName] before it was mainstream. We are the only ones who have an authentic respect for your beautiful, exotic culture."
 AS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Everywhere I go, I hear [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] citizens talking about how amazing [From.GetSpeciesAdj] culture must be. It seems so exotic, and yet so genuine, to them."
 AS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "[Root.GetSpeciesAdj] foodies really love the cuisine from the [From.GetName]. It's like getting to know an entire culture just from eating a few dishes!"
 AS_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "We usually prefer to explore the wonders of different cultures, but your culture is so depraved and full of oppression it's better we destroy it with fire."
 AS_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Check your damn privilege, [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]. We fight the [From.GetName] and its oppressive ways!"
 AS_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "We're trying to engage in 'dialogue' when we should be killing each other in the battlefield. This is what they call irony."

 SI_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Pray tell what you want from us. We are not eager to engage with xenos."
 SI_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Right then... quickly explain your intentions. We will probably not agree to your inane requests, but who knows."
 SI_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Admittedly the threat that the [From.GetName] poses to our innocent civilians is high. We have instructed them to keep calm and carry on, and we will continue to watch you warily. We do not want any trouble."
 SI_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "We always have a smashing good time when [From.GetSpeciesAdj] ambassadors come to visit. Let us drink some herbal concoctions before we engage in negotiations."

 SI_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Even if we lose, we will brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves, that if the [Root.GetName] lasts for a thousand years, they will still say, 'This was their finest hour.' We will prevail against your tyranny in this war."
 SI_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "I say, nice brawl we are having, aren't we, old chap? I do enjoy these little exchange of pleasantries in between battle, even though we must slay you in the end."
 # Vassal greetings

Our representatives are currently all busy negotiating with more civilized xenos unlike the barbarian [From.GetSpeciesName]. Currently, it will take... two hundred years for the next representative to be available. Thank you for waiting. If you wish to hear this message again, please press 4."
 EB_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "We prefer not to engage in negotiations with the pathetic parasites from [From.GetName]. According to the latest guidelines published by Administrative Guidelines Agency in concurrence with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the [From.GetName] is not to be trusted, and I can see why."
 EB_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Why am I meeting with you? This must be some sort of clerical error. Senior [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] bureaucrats have told me we have no interest in the savages that call themselves the [From.GetName]. Very well, you may speak, but I will have to file a complaint with the Department of Scheduling and Meetings after this."
 EB_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Now serving number... wait, who are you again? Oh, you are one of those undeveloped [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]s from the [From.GetName]. This was not supposed to be on my schedule, you were supposed to be with a lesser representative who meets with inferior primitives such as yourself. Can someone get my secretary?"
 EB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Welcome to the [Root.GetName]. Before we begin negotiations, please complete these forms here. Yes, specifically form AT6X-231, 32P9, TT4-01, 6GJKF-F, and CU11-7. There are several other forms you need to do as well, but you must see the Domestic Security Commission to get them. Oh, also, we only accept black ink."
 EB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Please wait a moment, I must file forms BX-22-A and KSD-34 for the Diplomatic Records Agency before we can begin negotiations. This will only take a few minutes, I assure you. Now... where did I put my pen.... I hope I didn't lose it, otherwise I would have to file a report to the DRA for that."
 EB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "There seems to be a mistake here. Why did you file form AT6X-224? You were supposed to file form AT6X-231. We cannot proceed with negotiations until you finish the correct form. Sorry, this is just administrative protocol. Your twenty other forms have been filed correctly at least. Here, you can borrow my pen."
 EB_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "The Bureau of Analysis and Statistics has determined the [From.GetName] is of greater strength than the [Root.GetName]. I must report to the Xeno Policy Agency soon so we can determine how to best proceed with such a violent, animalistic aggressor."
 EB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "I unfortunately have a schedule conflict, but meeting with our friends from the [From.GetName] is much more important than whatever bureaucratic business I might have had. After all, we will happily cut through any red tape if it allows for us to continue our beneficial relationship with you."

Our representatives are currently all busy negotiating with more barbaric xenos unlike the civilized [From.GetSpeciesName].

 ST_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Go away! We wouldn't want to sell any of our slaves to you. Even that would be too much for them."
 ST_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Have you come here to offer yourselves as our slaves? The offer's tempting, but we wouldn't take it. You're not fit to be slaves, selling you would result in no financial gain whatsoever."
 ST_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "We are so very tempted to just seize your territories and enslave your entire populace, but we have yet to calculate the profits from that."
 ST_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Have you come to do business with the [Root.GetName]? We specialize in the slave trade but are also willing to trade in other commodities such as foodstuffs, raw materials, and processed goods."
 ST_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "You better not be one of those annoying idealists coming to tell us about how terrible we are for our slave trade. They just don't understand that life in this galaxy doesn't work according to their ideals."
 ST_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "We are more than happy to work together with you to make a profit. Buying slaves now might prove to be a worthwhile investment for the [From.GetName] in the future."
 ST_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "What do you want? Just leave us be. We know you could easily destroy our entire economy, but we see that you are restrianing for now. What, are you going to try to 'free' our slaves? Realize that it won't do anything - there are plenty of more worthwhile lands you can conquer, other slaves to free."
 ST_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "My friend! It's a delight to see you! I must give you a gift. Would you like a highly-valued pleasure slave, skilled in many forms of entertainment? Or a warrior slave, to defend you forever and ever more? If you want something else I would be happy to give you some other gift such as authentic [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] food or such luxuries..."
 ST_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "If there are ever any [From.GetSpeciesAdj] slaves in the [Root.GetName], we try our best to ensure that they are given to kind and wise masters. We always want to make sure our [From.GetSpeciesAdj] friends are treated well, even if they are slaves!"

 ST_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "You know we do not enjoy waging war, given the risks it poses, but sometimes we have to do what we have to do. At the least, this war gives us new opportunities to acquire some [From.GetSpeciesAdj] slaves."
 ST_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "I hope that any [Root.GetSpeciesName] master that happens to own a [From.GetSpeciesAdj] slave treats them horribly! We will continue to fight until every last [From.GetSpeciesName] is enslaved and sold to the highest bidder!"

 SP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "There are always new opportunities to trade, and some [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] merchants have expressed interest in the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] market. Perhaps the [Root.GetName] and the [From.GetName] shall negotiate a treaty acceptable to us both. An exchange of goods, as well as ideas and cultures, would be encouraging."
 SP_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "The [From.GetName] is like a rose with thorns. Dangerous, lethal even, but the [Root.GetSpeciesName] cannot deny it has a certain beauty and allure. We only hope you are more the latter than the former."
 SP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Many think of wealth and power as the greatest of achievements, but in this galaxy good health is peerless. The [Root.GetName] sends nothing but well wishes to the [From.GetName], that the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] state may forever be strong and healthy until the end of days!"
 SP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Welcome, welcome! Let us feast and enjoy ourselves first, before we start negotiations. Exotic fruits? Gourmet delicacies? The sweetest of desserts? Anything for the most esteemed and venerable representatives of the [From.GetName]."
 SP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Ah, you know, friend, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] products sell for high prices in our bazaars. It seems that many in the [Root.GetName] have taken a liking to the goods your people produce."
 SP_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Death is so fleeting, but glory is forever. The deeds of [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] warriors as they defeat their [From.GetSpeciesAdj] foes shall be remembered by generations to come!"
 SP_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "We grant you the courtesy of meeting us during war. We expect that you come here for good reason, ergo. Perhaps you are here to surrender?"
 SP_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Our warriors are some of the mightiest in the galaxy. I am sure your [From.GetSpeciesAdj] weaklings are cowaring at the thought of battling our armies and fleets."
 # Vassal greetings
 SP_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "The [Root.GetName] is not used to serving other nations, but we must do what we must. How can we help you, o mighty and wise [From.GetSpeciesName]?"
 # Declaration of War
 SP_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! We shall besiege every single one of your planets. Your defenses shall be no match for our mighty bombardments!"
 
 # Enterprising Corsairs
 EC_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "We now cast covetous eyes on the vulnerable citizens of the [From.GetName], for they would make good slaves.... Careful now, good friend, we might just be tempted to take them and sell them to the highest bidder."
 EC_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "It is clear that the [From.GetSpeciesName] is only good for two things: either to toil for us as physical laborers, or serve us as pleasure slaves. Sometimes we wonder why we even let you have your independence. Perhaps we shall rectify that problem someday, by conquering and enslaving every last [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 EC_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Well? What is it? We're not selling any of our slaves to you."
 EC_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "We consider ourselves progressive-minded. Anyone can be a master, anyone can join the ranks of the [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] fleets and become a feared captain. But it seems that the spineless [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] can never be a master, only a slave."
 EC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "We are a nation of slavers and pirates, and take no shame in that. However, we also consider ourselves traders and men of culture and diplomacy. If you treat us with respect, we shall do the same to you."
 EC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Are you here to purchase some slaves? Come one, come all! Slaves from the furthest corners of the galaxy. Strong, strapling guards to protect you! Exotic, beautiful slaves skilled in the art of lovemaking! Intelligent, literate bondservants to help with your daily administrative needs! We have it all!"
 EC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Ah, we were expecting you. It is true we have a few [From.GetSpeciesAdj] slaves on sale. If you wish to purchase their freedom, just have your money ready and I will be more than happy to help you."
 EC_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Your ships threaten our trade routes and ability to launch raids. It is not a good situation for the [Root.GetName], but we've seen worse!"
 EC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Good friend! Come, join us and eat some delicacies before we get to business - some of the most delicious of delights from the most exotic corners of the galaxy. We're quite good at acquiring these, and I'm more than happy to give you some to take home with you if you so wish!"
 EC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Rest assured that our leader, [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName], has stipulated that any [From.GetSpeciesName] wrongly captured as a slave shall be immediately set free. It is the least we can do to ensure that our good, profitable relations will remain so, for your friendship is important to us."
 EC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Who are your enemies, dear [From.GetSpeciesAdj] friend? Tell us where they are, and we shall consider raiding their worlds for slaves. If we are successful, we shall sell you those slaves for very low prices!"
 EC_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesName] shall all be enslaved! Hahaha! Why stop now? We will acquire so many slaves from this war, the profits shall be endless!"
 EC_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Would you like some exotic sweets, good enemy of ours? They are not poisoned, we guarantee. Just a courtesy. You'll all be our slaves soon, anyways, so it's not that much a loss to us."
 EC_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Many of our brave and sly warriors are instructed to seize any [From.GetSpeciesName] they see so that they could be sold on the slave markets. Such are the customs of war for the [Root.GetName]!"
 # Vassal greetings
 EC_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "O noble and wise masters! What can the [Root.GetName] do for the [From.GetName] today? The strength of our commerce is great under your guidance."
 # Declaration of War
 EC_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! Every last [From.GetSpeciesName] will either soon serve a [Root.GetSpeciesName] as a slave, or be sold for high prices on the galactic market!"
 
 # Slave Soldiers
 SLS_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "We value bravery even among our enemies and rivals, but sometimes I'm not sure whether the warriors of the [From.GetName] have any. I'm sure they have a little bit of courage... somehow."
 SLS_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Ha, if it isn't the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]s. Why don't we have a contest between our mightiest warriors to see who is stronger? It will admitedly be an unfair match, given how much stronger the [Root.GetSpeciesName] is, so I'm sure ours will win by a long shot."
 SLS_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Be careful, [From.GetSpeciesName]. Your merchants are not welcome in the [From.GetName]. Who knows if someone might want to... steal their valuable goods."
 SLS_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "We are the true lords of the galaxy. Born of the [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] slave warrior castes, we were meant to rule. But the [From.GetName]... ha! What weaklings."
 SLS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Remember that though our most esteemed ruler, [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName], was born of the slave castes, all our leaders are, so do not look down on us as a nation of slaves. There is no shame in being a slave among the [Root.GetSpeciesName] so long as you prove yourself a worthy warrior and leader."
 SLS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "We believe that it is better to be a valorous slave than a cowardly master. Would the [From.GetSpeciesName] agree?"
 SLS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Our rulers hail from the caste of warrior slaves. They have been taught to fight and to lead since birth. It is why [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] warriors are among the greatest in the galaxy."
 SLS_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Do not scorn us merely because we are ruled by slave lords, [From.GetSpeciesName]! We have bravery and honor - can you say the same?"
 SLS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "It is good to see you friend! Many [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] [Root.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] say they wish to test their arms against [From.GetSpeciesAdj] warriors, for it is said that the soldiers of [From.GetName] are among the best in the galaxy!"
 SLS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Whenever we look across the vast galaxy, there are few we hold in higher regard than the [From.GetName]. To impress the slave lords of the [Root.GetName] is quite a feat."
 SLS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Your merchants are always welcome in the [Root.GetName]. We will do our best to ensure they are protected. We are as honorable and just as we are brave and strong."
 SLS_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "This is a trial of strength! There is no time for talking. Our slave warriors shall best the greatest of your armies."
 SLS_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Come now! Have a little bit more courage! There's no need to stop the fighting yet."
 SLS_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "I would be careful if I were you, [From.GetSpeciesName]. Our warrior slaves have been trained since birth to fight and to kill. Your leaders may have been born free, but what use is that freedom if they can't defend it? That is why we will win in the end."
 # Vassal greetings
 SLS_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Our masters from the [From.GetName] arrive! We are your loyal and most faithful servants, mere slaves ready to do your beckoning."
 # Declaration of War
 SLS_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! The slave lords of the [Root.GetName] have longed to test the strength of our arms against the villainous [From.GetSpeciesName]. Let's see what you are made of!"
 
 # Warrior Mystics
 WM_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "How incessant is the rambling of the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]! Silence is like the vastness of the universe. Speech is but the life span of a mere planet."
 WM_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "We must coexist in harmony, but you try our patience, o [From.GetSpeciesName]. Sometimes, we must make exceptions."
 WM_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "The world is full of darkness, and much of that comes from the [From.GetName]."
 WM_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Every [From.GetSpeciesName] I have ever met was full of impatience and a lack of wisdom. It is little wonder that the [From.GetName] lacks strength and prestige in the galactic community."
 WM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "There can be no reason without love, no love without reason. Let the [Root.GetName] and the [From.GetName] co-exist, whether in conflict or in peace, we shall live as we must."
 WM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Come, come, whoever you are. Wanderer, thinker, lover — it doesn't matter. The [Root.GetName] is not a caravan of despair."
 WM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "The [Root.GetSpeciesName] were born to travel through the stars. Why would anyone prefer to crawl through life?"
 WM_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Do you come to seek the truth of the universe? So do we. We will contemplate, we will fight, we will love, so long as it is a means to gain better understanding. Yes, you possess much worldly strength. But never underestimate the weak."
 WM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Friend, if you are ever wholly perplexed and in straits, have patience, for patience is the key to joy. We are here to help you, likewise, so whenever you need assistance, never be afraid to call on us."
 WM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "The galaxy is ancient and full of wonders. Why is everyone always so rushed? We are glad that we can take time to enjoy the beauty of the universe with our [From.GetSpeciesAdj] friends."
 WM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "There are many in the universe who seek to undo our bonds, but I think they are fools to think that they can break the close ties of friendship between our two peoples."
 WM_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "The darkness in the hearts of every [From.GetSpeciesName] is disconcerting. It is something we must fight against."
 WM_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Death is but a fleeting experience. This war, too, will end one day, and be a mere memory in the minds of both [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] [Root.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] and [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural]."
 WM_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Our warriors are not only mighty and strong, but full of wisdom, patience, and compassion. That is why they are the envy of the galaxy, and that is why our victory against the forces of [From.GetSpeciesAdj] darkness is inevitable."
 # Vassal greetings
 WM_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "The [Root.GetName] is but a planet, a mere satellite, that revolves around the [From.GetName] which is like the sun to us."
 # Declaration of War
 WM_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! The time for harmonious co-existence is over, and it is time for contentious co-existence!"
 
 # Aspiring Precursors
 AP_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Your presence is not welcome. Our intentions are to enlighten the primitive races of this galaxy, not engage in fruitless dialogue with [From.GetSpeicesAdj] [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult]. Leave us!"
 AP_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "How can we continue our work of enlightening the rest of the galaxy if you keep interrupting us?"
 AP_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "We do not think the [From.GetName] can be trusted. It is best you leave the task of teaching and guiding the younger races to those like us who actually have genuine good intentions."
 AP_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "The [From.GetName] is a primitive and backward nation, judging by your poverty and lack of progress. Do you need our guidance, child?"
 AP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "We see ourselves as protectors of the younger races. In time, they will mature and join the galactic community under our guidance. Our intentions are benevolent - are yours?"
 AP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "The galaxy filled with children waiting to grow and mature. Will you join us in guiding these younger races to fulfill their destiny, or will you choose the path of hostility and aggression? If it is the latter, we will do whatever we can to protect our children."
 AP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "The galaxy is ancient and full of wonders. We, the [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural], hope to show the many young and innocent races of this unicerse those wonders."
 AP_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "You are mighty and strong. Should you not use your knowledge and wisdom to enlighten lesser, primitive races? Join us in this monumental task and use your powers for the greater good!"
 AP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Someday, all the younger races of the galaxy will be fully mature, thanks to our combined efforts. We must continue our good work, friend!"
 AP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "We hope that one day, in the distant future, the once ignorant and primitive races of this galaxy will look to the [Root.GetName] and the [From.GetName] as an example of the progress and prosperity that can arise when two great nations come together in an atmosphere of cooperation and mutual understanding."
 AP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Together, the [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] and the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have united to instruct and mentor the younger races. One day, they shall appreciate us as [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] [Root.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] and [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] appreciate their beloved parents."
 AP_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "The [From.GetName] are a bunch of self-righteous manure-eaters. By defeating you, we hope to pave way for a more prosperous future for the rest of the galaxy."
 AP_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "We merely seek to enlighten the rest of the galaxy and ensure their progress, but you on the other hand seek to bring destruction to all. Even if we lose, the galaxy shall not forget our righteous cause!"
 AP_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "When younger races look back towards the glorious history of their precursors, the [Root.GetName], they will remember the [From.GetName] as a pitiful hive of scum and villainy that was defeated by our great soldiers."
 # Vassal greetings
